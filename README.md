# Medical-appointments EDA case study

This case study is the final project of Data Analysis Professional Nanodegree Program.


In this project, I will analyze a dataset contains information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment, and then will communicate my findings about it.

**I will begin with the data wrangling proccess then some cleaning before the EDA phase in which we gonna know and find answers to some questions to know better about the data**


Questions I will focus on answering using python(Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib) are :
--
Q1 : Is there any specific gender who is not showing up for the appointment?

Q2 : Is recieving a SMS can decrease the proportion of patients not showing up?

Q3 : Is there a relation between the neighbourhood and showing up for the appointemnt?

Q4 : Is thera a specific age group associated with "no-show" visits?
